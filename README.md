# Perceptron-Learning-Algorithm

## ðŸ¤– Perceptron Learning Algorithm â€“ 3D Classification
This project explores the implementation and analysis of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm for binary classification tasks on 3-dimensional data points. It is divided into three parts: training the perceptron, analyzing linear separability, and evaluating convergence behavior.
